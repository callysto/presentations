    "Callysto's Weekly Data Visualization is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills. We provide Grades 5-12 teachers and students with a data visualization, like a graph, to interpret. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualization is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",
