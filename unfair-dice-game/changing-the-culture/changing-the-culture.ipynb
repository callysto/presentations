How can we create a scenario involving two or more individuals, each with differing degrees of advantage, and observe how slight advantages (or disadvantages) affect their trajectories over time? \n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the concept of fairness as well as the concepts of expected and experimental probability via a probability game between two players in which one player possesses a fixed slight advantage over the other. We will solve the “Unfair Dice Problem” via an exploratory approach, and using Jupyter notebooks and the Python programming language, we will develop an interactive application that allows us to simulate how each player fares over time.  This work is part of the Callysto Project, a federally-funded program to bring computational thinking and mathematical problem-solving skills into Grade 5-12 classrooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unfair Dice Problem has relevance and application in multiple areas of life, including but not limited to the role small advantages play in the context of employment, housing, access to education and support, mortgages and loan pre-approval, and social advancement and recognition. Although our application is based on a game involving dice, it is an illustration of the effect that seemingly small advantages can play over a long period of time in the outcome that individuals experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 align='center'>Real Life Application Example</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "One example is the role socio-economic status play in academic success. Let's take the case of two students going into university. Student A owns a car, lives near school and does not need to take out student loans. Student B on the other hand, has taken out a loan to pay for classes, works part time to decrease the amount of money they need to borrow, and rents a room that is far from school but cheap, they use public transit every day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, Student A experiences less stress and is able to devote more time to studying which results in higher marks, being able to access higher-level classes and graduate school. Because student A is a top performer, it is easy for them to get internships and valuable work experience and as a result, Student A has higher probability of getting a high-pay job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Student B on the other hand is constantly stressed over debt, cannot spend as much time on studying as they work part time and as a result does not excel in school. This decreases their opportunities to be accepted into higher-level education and graduate school, as well as getting an intership - both of which would support student B in getting a high-paying job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through computational thinking we can model problems like the above to simulate people's outcome overtime. We can use this information to modify the conditions of the model to balance unfairness - for instance by providing scholarships based on need, by modifying entry-level requirements to include work experience in addition to grades, and to support creating affordable living options for students. Another solution might be running a survey of socio-economic status and available resources, and adjust tuition accordingly, instead of charging everyone the same amount. "
